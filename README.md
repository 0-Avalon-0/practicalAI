### Running the notebooks
1. Access the notebooks at https://goku.me/practicalAI or in the `notebooks` directory in this repo.
2. Replace `https://github.com/` with `https://colab.research.google.com/github/` in the notebook URL or use this [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/open-in-colab/iogfkhleblhcpcekbiedikdehleodpjo) to do it with one click.
3. Sign into your Google account.
4. Click the `COPY TO DRIVE` button on the toolbar. This will open the notebook on a new tab.
